# Title

Claiire Repo Cleanup And Architecture/Documentation Conventions

# Status

Ready. This spec defines a high-risk repository cleanup and governance migration. It passed `/101-sf-ready` after the remaining ambiguities were reduced to explicit implementation constraints rather than operator-owned decisions.

# User Story

En tant qu'operatrice du monorepo Claiire, je veux une structure site/app et une documentation ShipFlow canonique, afin que les agents puissent maintenir le projet sans confusion, doublon ni dette de rangement.

# Minimal Behavior Contract

When an agent opens the Claiire repository, the repo must clearly present one monorepo with `site/` for the Astro website and `app/` for the mobile app source directly, with no nested `app/app` package, no embedded BMAD framework corpus, no unclassified inspiration dump in product source, and one canonical documentation corpus under `shipflow_data/` scoped by surface. If a file is shared, it must live in the shared canonical location; if it is site-only or app-only, it must be under the corresponding `shipflow_data/<domain>/<surface>/` path. If any move cannot be proven safe, implementation must stop before deletion and leave a recoverable classified staging state. The easiest edge case to miss is deleting or moving symlinked trackers, generated Convex files, lockfiles, or inspiration material before confirming whether they are source, generated output, external vendor content, or reusable reference material.

# Success Behavior

- A fresh agent can run `pnpm list --depth -1 --recursive` and see the intended workspace packages: `site` and the mobile app package directly at `app/`.
- `app/app/` no longer exists as the active source path; its source has either been moved into `app/` or explicitly staged for review before deletion.
- `app/_bmad/` no longer exists in the Claiire repo and is preserved under a user-home archive path such as `/home/claude/bmad` or `/home/claude/bmad-claiire` with provenance notes.
- `app/Inspiration/` no longer pollutes product source. It is classified before relocation into a project governance/reference area, with final destination documented before destructive removal from the original path.
- Root legacy trackers/docs are removed or converted to allowed compatibility symlinks only where ShipFlow conventions allow them.
- `shipflow_data/` contains the canonical docs with metadata frontmatter and a clear shared/site/app split.
- The site no longer exposes ShipFlow debug/inspector scripts or hardcoded public upload keys in production assets.
- Build/check/test commands run against the correct packages and failures are documented with owner routes.

# Error Behavior

- If the worktree contains unrelated dirty changes, implementation must stop or isolate the migration so those changes are not overwritten.
- If a file move would overwrite a target or lose history/provenance, implementation must stop and create a conflict note in the spec or handoff.
- If `app/Inspiration/` classification cannot decide whether an item is reference, source, vendor, generated, or discardable, do not delete it; move only to a clearly named quarantine/review area or ask the operator for that specific class.
- If BMAD already exists under the intended user-home destination, do not overwrite it; create a timestamped/claiire-scoped archive path and document it.
- If package manager or workspace changes make checks fail, do not mask the failure with lockfile churn; report the exact command, package, and failing dependency.
- Secrets, API keys, tokens, cookies, private user data, and debug upload endpoints must never remain in public assets or be copied into reports.

# Problem

Claiire is intended to be a monorepo, but the current layout is not a clean monorepo. The site and app are mixed with legacy docs, duplicate trackers, an app nested under `app/app`, stale root package metadata under `app/`, large tracked inspiration/prototype dumps, and an embedded `_bmad` framework corpus. This makes package filtering unreliable, causes agents to inspect or test the wrong package, and violates the ShipFlow documentation convention that governance artifacts live under `shipflow_data/`.

The audit also found a separate security/build issue: the public site loads ShipFlow debug scripts globally and contains a hardcoded ImgBB upload key in public JavaScript. The site build currently fails on the Clerk/Astro integration. These issues are coupled to cleanup because they affect whether the repository is safe and verifiable after restructuring.

# Solution

Perform a staged repository cleanup:

1. Freeze and document current dirty state.
2. Move the mobile app source from `app/app/` to `app/`, retiring the stale `app/package.json` and legacy app-level docs.
3. Move BMAD out of the repo to a user-home archive and remove it from git scope.
4. Classify `app/Inspiration/` before moving it into the appropriate `shipflow_data` reference/research structure or a review quarantine.
5. Canonicalize all Markdown/documentation into `shipflow_data/`, keeping branding centralized and splitting app/site-specific governance by surface.
6. Fix workspace/package-manager paths and validation commands.
7. Remove public debug/security leaks and restore build/check proof.

# Scope In

- Restructure active source:
  - `site/` remains the Astro website.
  - `app/` becomes the mobile app package root.
  - `app/app/` is eliminated as an active source directory.
- Update `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, lockfiles, package names, package-manager pins, scripts, and workspace filters to match the final monorepo.
- Move or remove stale `app/package.json`, `app/package-lock.json`, `app/.kilocode/package-lock.json`, and package-manager leftovers according to the final package layout.
- Move `app/_bmad/` outside the repo into the current user's home on the server, preserving provenance.
- Classify `app/Inspiration/` material before moving it to a governance/reference location under `shipflow_data/` or a review quarantine.
- Canonicalize docs:
  - Shared branding stays centralized under `shipflow_data/branding/`.
  - Site docs live under `shipflow_data/{business,editorial,technical,workflow}/site/`.
  - App docs live under `shipflow_data/{business,product,technical,workflow}/app/`.
  - Root `TASKS.md` and `AUDIT_LOG.md` are removed as legacy files unless an explicit compatibility symlink is needed and allowed.
  - Legacy `app/BUSINESS.md`, `app/BRANDING.md`, `app/GUIDELINES.md`, `app/CLAUDE.md`, `app/DEV_IDEAS.md`, `app/README.md`, and app-local trackers are migrated or removed from active source.
- Add required ShipFlow frontmatter metadata to canonical docs when missing.
- Remove or gate public ShipFlow inspector/Eruda scripts and hardcoded upload keys from site assets.
- Restore validation proof for affected packages.

# Scope Out

- No redesign of Claiire site or mobile UI.
- No product repositioning beyond preserving current site/app separation and shared branding.
- No rewrite of the mobile app features, Convex schema, Clerk flows, gamification, or content strategy unless needed to preserve paths after moving `app/app` to `app`.
- No final editorial decision on every inspiration item unless classification evidence is sufficient.
- No deployment, production verification, commit, push, or release in this spec phase.
- No broad dependency upgrade beyond what is necessary to restore package/workspace correctness and build proof.

# Constraints

- Preserve unrelated dirty changes. The current worktree already contains modified dependency/tracker files and untracked root trackers.
- Use `git mv` or equivalent history-preserving moves during implementation where practical.
- Do not delete BMAD or Inspiration material until a recoverable copy/classification exists.
- Do not keep secrets or upload keys in public assets.
- Do not create parallel documentation doctrines outside `shipflow_data/`.
- Do not keep root legacy docs except allowed compatibility files: `README.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` symlink to `AGENT.md`, and optional `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Monorepo governance root is the repository root `shipflow_data/`.
- Branding is shared and centralized; app/site may reference it but must not fork it.
- Runtime docs freshness must be checked before finalizing fixes that depend on Astro, Clerk, Expo, pnpm, Convex, Vercel, or React Native behavior.
- Sentry/diagnostics posture must be preserved or explicitly documented: the site has auth/protected/member surfaces and the app is runtime/user-specific, so static-site exception cannot be assumed globally.

# Test Contract

surface: mixed monorepo (`Astro/Vercel/Clerk` site + `Expo/React Native/Convex/Clerk` app + ShipFlow governance docs)
proof_profile: destructive migration with workspace, documentation, and public-security validation
proof_order:
1. Inventory and dirty-worktree isolation
2. Workspace/package discovery proof
3. Source-tree move proof
4. Public debug/security removal proof
5. Site checks/build proof
6. Mobile package test/check proof
7. Documentation canonical-path proof
checklist_path: none
required_scenario_ids:
- SC-01 workspace detects `site` and `app/` as the only active packages
- SC-02 nested `app/app/` is no longer an active source path
- SC-03 `_bmad` is preserved outside the repo and removed from git scope
- SC-04 `Inspiration` is classified before any destructive removal
- SC-05 public inspector/upload/debug assets are removed or fully gated out of production
- SC-06 canonical docs exist under `shipflow_data/` with allowed shared/site/app split
- SC-07 site check/build commands target the correct package
- SC-08 mobile tests/checks target the correct package after flattening
required_results:
- `git status --short --branch` captured before and after migration, with unrelated dirty changes isolated
- `pnpm list --depth -1 --recursive` proves workspace package discovery
- `pnpm --filter claiire check` passes
- `pnpm --filter claiire build` passes or remains blocked with a focused owner issue and fresh-docs evidence
- `pnpm --dir app test` or an equivalent final app validation command targets the real mobile package after flattening
- `rg -n "IMGBB_API_KEY|shipflow-inspector|shipflow-eruda|buildflowz-inspector|eruda|api.imgbb.com" site/src site/public` proves public debug/upload scripts are removed or gated
- `find . -maxdepth 4 \( -name 'AUDIT_LOG.md' -o -name 'TASKS.md' -o -name 'BUSINESS.md' -o -name 'BRANDING.md' -o -name 'GUIDELINES.md' -o -name 'CLAUDE.md' \)` proves docs/trackers are in canonical or allowed compatibility paths
- `git ls-files app/_bmad app/Inspiration app/app` proves removed/non-active paths no longer remain tracked when the migration is complete
exception_with_proof:
- `app/Inspiration/` destructive deletion is not allowed until a classification report exists and ambiguous items are either quarantined or explicitly reviewed
- `_bmad` removal from the repo is not allowed until a non-overwriting destination under `/home/claude/` is verified
exception_without_proof: none

# Dependencies

- Local repo evidence:
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml` currently includes `site` and `app`.
  - `pnpm list --depth -1 --recursive` currently reports `tmv-app@1.0.0 /home/claude/claiire/app` and `claiire@0.0.1 /home/claude/claiire/site`, not the real Expo app under `app/app`.
  - `site/package.json` pins `packageManager: pnpm@11.8.0` and `engines.node: 24.x`.
  - `app/app/package.json` defines the real Expo package named `app`.
- ShipFlow governance:
  - `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/canonical-paths.md`
  - `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/decision-quality-contract.md`
  - `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/chantier-tracking.md`
  - `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/reporting-contract.md`
- External docs:
  - `fresh-docs checked`: pnpm official docs confirm recursive/package listing on workspace packages and package selection through `--filter`, which is enough to anchor workspace validation commands for this chantier.
  - `fresh-docs checked`: Clerk Astro official docs confirm that Clerk must be added as an Astro integration and SSR requires an SSR-capable adapter with `output: 'server'`.
  - `fresh-docs required during implementation`: if the Clerk/Astro build issue remains after repository cleanup, implementation must re-check current official docs for the installed package versions before changing auth/build integration behavior.

# Invariants

- `site/` is the website source.
- `app/` is the mobile app source.
- `shipflow_data/branding/branding.md` is the shared branding source of truth.
- Surface-specific docs must not duplicate shared branding; they may reference it.
- `shipflow_data/workflow/specs/` is the chantier registry.
- Root `TASKS.md` and `AUDIT_LOG.md` are legacy and must not be canonical.
- Public site bundles must not include debug upload tooling, hardcoded API keys, or ShipFlow internal inspectors.
- Build/test commands must target the real package, not stale shell packages.

# Links & Consequences

- Flattening `app/app` into `app` affects imports, Expo Router path assumptions, Convex generated paths, app assets, `.env.example`, `.npmrc`, `.gitignore`, `eas.json`, `tsconfig.json`, Jest config, and lockfile ownership.
- Removing `_bmad` from repo reduces tracked-file noise but may affect any local workflow references that expect `app/_bmad`; these must be searched and updated.
- Moving `Inspiration` out of app source reduces source-tree noise but requires a classification index so useful references remain discoverable.
- Canonicalizing docs changes how agents find product truth; all legacy references in app/site docs must be updated.
- Removing public inspectors improves security/privacy but may remove a manual QA convenience; a safe non-public diagnostics route should replace it if needed.
- Fixing workspace package discovery is prerequisite for reliable dependency, test, build, and ship checks.

# Documentation Coherence

Required canonical documentation after implementation:
- `shipflow_data/branding/branding.md`: shared brand contract with metadata frontmatter.
- `shipflow_data/business/site/business.md`: site business contract with metadata.
- `shipflow_data/editorial/site/guidelines.md`: site editorial/copy contract with metadata.
- `shipflow_data/technical/site/README.md`: site development guide updated to pnpm, Node, Astro 6, current domain, and real commands.
- `shipflow_data/technical/site/CLAUDE.md`: site technical agent guide updated to actual package/build/auth/runtime behavior.
- `shipflow_data/business/app/business.md`: app business contract migrated from `app/BUSINESS.md`, with metadata.
- `shipflow_data/branding/branding.md`: shared app/site brand reference; app-specific visual guidance may live under `shipflow_data/product/app/` or `shipflow_data/technical/app/` only if it does not fork shared brand truth.
- `shipflow_data/technical/app/CLAUDE.md`: app technical guide migrated from `app/CLAUDE.md`, corrected so it no longer points to site docs as app source of truth.
- `shipflow_data/workflow/app/` and `shipflow_data/workflow/site/`: surface-specific trackers only where needed.
- `shipflow_data/research/app/` for classified inspiration indexes and reusable app references, plus a clearly named quarantine/review subpath if some items cannot be decided immediately.

# Edge Cases

- `app/app/TASKS.md` is a symlink to `/home/claude/shipflow_data/projects/app/TASKS.md`; do not blindly move/delete without deciding whether it is legacy and whether external ShipFlow data still uses it.
- `app/app/convex/_generated/*` may be generated but tracked; classify before removal.
- `site/package-lock.json` is already deleted in the dirty worktree; do not assume this deletion is accepted until reviewed.
- `site/.node-version` is untracked; decide whether Node pin belongs at repo root, package root, or both.
- `app/package.json` is stale `tmv-app`; moving app source into `app/` must replace it cleanly with the real Expo package metadata.
- Large Inspiration folders may contain useful source material, generated prototypes, copyrighted/vendor examples, or throwaway exports; they need classification before final placement.
- BMAD may already exist elsewhere in `/home/claude`; avoid overwriting a shared copy.
- Removing debug scripts may reveal missing manual QA tooling; replace with a private/dev-only mechanism if the workflow still needs it.
- `pnpm --filter <name>` becomes fragile if package names are kept generic; path-based commands such as `pnpm --dir app ...` are acceptable for this chantier and do not require a package rename.

# Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: Freeze current state and create a migration inventory.
  - File: `shipflow_data/workflow/specs/claiire-repo-cleanup-architecture-doc-conventions.md`
  - Action: Before edits, record `git status --short --branch`, package list, tracked BMAD/Inspiration counts, and doc/tracker locations in the implementation handoff or run history.
  - User story link: Prevents accidental loss or overwrite while cleaning the repo.
  - Depends on: None.
  - Validate with: `git status --short --branch`; `git ls-files app/Inspiration app/_bmad | wc -l`; `find . -maxdepth 4 \( -name 'AUDIT_LOG.md' -o -name 'TASKS.md' -o -name 'CLAUDE.md' \)`.
  - Notes: Stop if unrelated dirty changes would be overwritten.

- [ ] Task 2: Define final monorepo package map.
  - File: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
  - Action: Update workspace packages so the real mobile app at `app/` and site at `site/` are discovered after flattening; remove stale package ambiguity.
  - User story link: Agents must test/build the right package.
  - Depends on: Task 1.
  - Validate with: `pnpm list --depth -1 --recursive`.
  - Notes: This chantier does not require a package rename. Path-based execution such as `pnpm --dir app ...` is acceptable if the package name remains generic.

- [ ] Task 3: Flatten mobile app source from `app/app/` to `app/`.
  - File: `app/`
  - Action: Move the real Expo app files from `app/app/` into `app/`, replacing stale `tmv-app` metadata and preserving `.env.example`, `app.json`, `eas.json`, `convex/`, `features/`, `assets/`, `tsconfig.json`, and package scripts.
  - User story link: The app must be directly under `app/` with no second nested `app`.
  - Depends on: Task 1.
  - Validate with: `test ! -d app/app`; `pnpm list --depth -1 --recursive`; mobile package test command after final package name is set.
  - Notes: Use history-preserving moves where possible. Resolve symlinked `TASKS.md` deliberately.

- [ ] Task 4: Move BMAD out of the repo.
  - File: `app/_bmad/`
  - Action: Move BMAD to a user-home archive path under `/home/claude/`, document the destination, then remove it from Claiire git scope.
  - User story link: Repo source must not include unrelated framework/vendor corpus.
  - Depends on: Task 1.
  - Validate with: `test ! -e app/_bmad`; `git ls-files app/_bmad | wc -l`; `test -d /home/claude/<bmad-destination>`.
  - Notes: Do not overwrite an existing `/home/claude/bmad`; use a claiire-scoped or timestamped destination if needed.

- [ ] Task 5: Classify `app/Inspiration/` before relocation.
  - File: `app/Inspiration/`
  - Action: Produce a classification index grouping each top-level item as `reference`, `prototype`, `research`, `vendor/generated`, `discard-candidate`, or `needs-operator-review`; move only after classification.
  - User story link: Preserve useful references without polluting product source.
  - Depends on: Task 1.
  - Validate with: classification report under `shipflow_data/research/` or `shipflow_data/workflow/reviews/`; `git ls-files app/Inspiration | wc -l` after approved relocation.
  - Notes: Because the operator said "on va voir ca", final destructive deletion of ambiguous inspiration material requires review.

- [ ] Task 6: Migrate Markdown and governance docs into `shipflow_data`.
  - File: `app/BUSINESS.md`, `app/BRANDING.md`, `app/GUIDELINES.md`, `app/CLAUDE.md`, `app/DEV_IDEAS.md`, `app/README.md`, `app/app/AUDIT_LOG.md`, `app/app/CHANGELOG.md`, root `TASKS.md`, root `AUDIT_LOG.md`, and existing `shipflow_data/**`.
  - Action: Move or merge docs into canonical shared/site/app paths with ShipFlow frontmatter; remove legacy originals except allowed compatibility files/symlinks.
  - User story link: Agents need one source of truth.
  - Depends on: Tasks 1 and 3.
  - Validate with: `find . -maxdepth 4 \( -name 'AUDIT_LOG.md' -o -name 'TASKS.md' -o -name 'BUSINESS.md' -o -name 'BRANDING.md' -o -name 'GUIDELINES.md' -o -name 'CLAUDE.md' \) | sort`; frontmatter spot checks.
  - Notes: Branding remains centralized. App-specific brand usage can reference shared branding but must not fork it.

- [ ] Task 7: Update docs references and stale commands.
  - File: `shipflow_data/technical/site/README.md`, `shipflow_data/technical/site/CLAUDE.md`, `shipflow_data/technical/app/CLAUDE.md`, package READMEs if retained.
  - Action: Replace npm commands with pnpm where applicable, correct Node/runtime pins, correct app/site source-of-truth links, document current domain inconsistency without inventing a new canonical domain, and remove references to deleted paths.
  - User story link: Fresh agents must not follow stale instructions.
  - Depends on: Task 6.
  - Validate with: `rg -n "npm install|npm run|app/app|app/_bmad|app/Inspiration|claiire.com|claiire.fr|site/CLAUDE|BUSINESS.md|GUIDELINES.md" shipflow_data app site -g '*.md'`.
  - Notes: Domain resolution is out of scope for this chantier; the required outcome is explicit documentation of the inconsistency so future edits do not silently mix both domains.

- [ ] Task 8: Remove public debug/security leaks from the site.
  - File: `site/src/layouts/DocsLayout.astro`, `site/src/layouts/StaticPageLayout.astro`, `site/public/shipflow-inspector.js`, `site/public/buildflowz-inspector.js`, `site/public/shipflow-eruda.js`.
  - Action: Remove public inspector/Eruda script loads and delete or dev-gate public debug assets; remove hardcoded ImgBB key and external upload path from public assets.
  - User story link: Repo cleanup must not leave public security/privacy risks.
  - Depends on: Task 1.
  - Validate with: `rg -n "IMGBB_API_KEY|api.imgbb.com|shipflow-inspector|buildflowz-inspector|shipflow-eruda|eruda" site/src site/public`.
  - Notes: If QA still needs screenshots, create a private/dev-only route or local tool outside production bundles.

- [ ] Task 9: Restore package-manager and build/test proof.
  - File: `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `site/package.json`, `app/package.json`, `.pnpmfile.cjs`, `site/.pnpmfile.cjs`, `.node-version` or equivalent runtime pin.
  - Action: Reconcile lockfiles and package-manager pins after moves; ensure site and app commands run against correct package roots.
  - User story link: Maintainability requires repeatable installs and checks.
  - Depends on: Tasks 2, 3, and 8.
  - Validate with: `pnpm install --lockfile-only` if needed; `pnpm list --depth -1 --recursive`; `pnpm --filter claiire check`; `pnpm --filter claiire build`; mobile package test/check command.
  - Notes: `fresh-docs required` before final Clerk/Astro/Vite build fix.

- [ ] Task 10: Final repository hygiene check.
  - File: repository root.
  - Action: Confirm forbidden paths are removed, canonical docs remain, ignored generated directories are not tracked, and worktree changes are limited to the chantier.
  - User story link: The repo should be clean enough for future projects to follow the same pattern.
  - Depends on: All previous tasks.
  - Validate with: `git status --short`; `git ls-files app/_bmad app/Inspiration app/app`; `git ls-files | rg '(^|/)node_modules/|(^|/)dist/|(^|/)\\.astro/|(^|/)\\.vercel/'`; `find shipflow_data -maxdepth 3 -type f | sort`.
  - Notes: Do not ship until build/security/doc gates are green or explicitly accepted as blocked follow-ups.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CA 1: Given the repo after migration, when `find app -maxdepth 2 -name package.json` runs, then the active mobile app package is directly under `app/package.json` and there is no active `app/app/package.json`.
- [ ] CA 2: Given the repo after migration, when `pnpm list --depth -1 --recursive` runs, then it lists the intended site and mobile app workspace packages without stale `tmv-app` ambiguity.
- [ ] CA 3: Given the repo after migration, when `git ls-files app/_bmad` runs, then it returns no tracked files, and the BMAD corpus is preserved under a documented `/home/claude/` destination.
- [ ] CA 4: Given the repo after migration, when `git ls-files app/Inspiration` runs, then it returns no tracked product-source dump files unless a reviewed exception is documented.
- [ ] CA 5: Given the repo after migration, when a fresh agent searches for business, technical, editorial, workflow, or app guidance, then canonical files are under `shipflow_data/` and legacy root/app docs are gone or allowed compatibility links only.
- [ ] CA 6: Given shared brand guidance, when app/site docs reference branding, then they point to `shipflow_data/branding/branding.md` and do not duplicate/fork the shared brand contract.
- [ ] CA 7: Given the public site source, when `rg` searches for ShipFlow inspector, Eruda, ImgBB, or hardcoded upload keys, then no production-loaded public asset exposes those debug/upload tools.
- [ ] CA 8: Given package validation, when site checks run, then `pnpm --filter claiire check` passes.
- [ ] CA 9: Given package validation, when site build runs, then `pnpm --filter claiire build` passes or the remaining failure has a focused owner issue with official-docs evidence.
- [ ] CA 10: Given package validation, when mobile tests/checks run through the final workspace filter, then they target the real mobile package and either pass or report focused implementation failures unrelated to workspace discovery.
- [ ] CA 11: Given repository hygiene proof, when generated-output patterns are checked, then `node_modules`, `dist`, `.astro`, and `.vercel` are ignored/untracked.
- [ ] CA 12: Given docs metadata proof, when canonical Markdown governance files are sampled, then they include ShipFlow frontmatter with artifact, schema version, status, scope, owner/confidence/risk where applicable, and next step/review fields.

# Test Strategy

- Start with read-only inventory and `git status` to protect existing dirty changes.
- Run package discovery before and after flattening.
- Validate site package with `pnpm --filter claiire check` and `pnpm --filter claiire build`.
- Validate mobile package with `pnpm --dir app test` or the final equivalent package-root command, plus any TypeScript/Expo checks available in the final package scripts.
- Use `rg` to prove public debug/security leaks are removed.
- Use `git ls-files` to prove BMAD/Inspiration/nested app paths are no longer tracked after migration.
- Use doc-location scans to prove ShipFlow governance conventions.
- Manual review: Inspiration classification and BMAD archive destination.

# Risks

- High risk of accidental file loss because the migration moves large directories and removes tracked corpora.
- High risk of masking unrelated dirty changes because the repo is already dirty.
- Security risk if public debug scripts or API keys remain in deployed assets.
- Build risk around Clerk/Astro/Vite and Node version mismatch.
- Package-manager risk from mixed `package-lock.json`, pnpm lockfile, stale `app/package.json`, and nested app package.
- Documentation drift risk if app/site docs are merged incorrectly or branding is duplicated instead of centralized.
- Future-agent risk if legacy paths remain and continue to misroute audits/tests.

# Execution Notes

- Read first:
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
  - `site/package.json`
  - `app/package.json`
  - `app/app/package.json`
  - `shipflow_data/technical/site/CLAUDE.md`
  - `app/CLAUDE.md`
  - `site/src/layouts/DocsLayout.astro`
  - `site/src/layouts/StaticPageLayout.astro`
- Use `git mv` where possible for app flattening and docs migration.
- Treat `app/Inspiration/` as classification-first; do not delete ambiguous references in the same step that classifies them.
- Treat `_bmad` move as external filesystem side effect; if implementation needs to remove/move large directories, get explicit approval when required by runtime policy.
- Fresh external docs already checked for readiness:
  - pnpm official docs: recursive/list/filtering behavior for workspace packages
  - Clerk Astro official docs: integration in `astro.config.mjs`, SSR adapter requirement, and `output: 'server'`
- Re-check official docs during implementation if package versions change or if the current build failure requires adapter/auth integration edits beyond cleanup.
- Sentry/observability: site has auth/protected/member/webhook surfaces, and app is user-specific runtime; static-site exception does not cover the whole monorepo. Do not add broad Sentry work in this cleanup unless it is already in project scope, but do document diagnostics gaps for follow-up if discovered.
- Stop if any command would overwrite existing user-home BMAD, delete unclassified Inspiration content, or revert unrelated dirty changes.

# Open Questions

None. Review-gated decisions were converted into explicit implementation constraints:
- `app/Inspiration/` must be classified before destructive cleanup, with ambiguous items quarantined instead of guessed.
- public domain inconsistency must be documented, not resolved, in this chantier.
- mobile package rename is not required; path-root execution is acceptable during this cleanup.
