### IDE Integrations (18 folders)
Each AI coding tool has its own folder with agents and workflows optimized for that platform.

## 🚀 BMAD Agents Available

### Core Agents (10)

6. **UX Designer** - User experience, wireframes
7. **Tech Writer** - Documentation
8. **Test Engineer & Architect** - Testing strategy
9. **Quick Flow Solo Dev** - Fast solo development
10. **BMad Master** - Meta-agent for guidance

### Workflow Categories (34 workflows)

**Planning & Analysis (8)**
- workflow-init, workflow-status
- create-product-brief, create-prd
- create-epics-and-stories, sprint-planning
- check-implementation-readiness, generate-project-context

**Design & Architecture (7)**

## 💡 What to Do Next

### Immediate Next Steps (Choose One)

#### Option A: Use a Template (Recommended for Speed)
```bash
# 1. Choose a template
# Recommended: turbo-expo-nextjs-clerk-convex-monorepo

# 2. Load PM or Architect agent in your AI assistant
# 3. Ask: "Help me integrate the [template-name] with this TMV app project"
```

#### Option B: Start from Scratch with BMAD
```bash
# 1. Open any agent in your AI coding assistant
# 2. Type: *workflow-init
# 3. Follow the guided workflow
```

### Step-by-Step Workflow

If starting from scratch, follow this sequence:

1. **Initialize** (`*workflow-init`)
   - Analyzes project
   - Recommends next steps

2. **Create Product Brief** (`*create-product-brief`)
   - Or use the existing shipflow_data/business/ or shipflow_data/technical/ docs

3. **Design Architecture** (`*create-architecture`)
   - System design
   - Technology choices
   - Data flow

4. **Plan Sprint** (`*sprint-planning`)
   - Break down work
   - Prioritize features

5. **Implement Features** (`*dev-story`)
   - Build one story at a time
   - Use Developer agent

6. **Review & Test** (`*code-review`)
   - Quality checks
   - Testing

### Recommended First Feature

**Sleep Tracking Feature** (simplest to validate the stack):

1. Load PM agent → Create user story
2. Load Architect agent → Design Convex schema
3. Load Developer agent → Implement mutations/queries
4. Load UX Designer → Create basic UI
5. Test the feature

This validates:
- Convex backend working
- Data persistence
- Basic UI flow
- Development workflow
