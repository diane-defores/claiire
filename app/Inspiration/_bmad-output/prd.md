## 2. Problem Narrative

**Target Persona:** Adults (25-45) managing mental health challenges, addictions, or chronic stress who struggle with consistent self-care routines.

**Core Pain Point:** Users attempting behavior change through wellness apps face an 85% dropout rate within the first month because existing solutions are either too clinical (feeling like medical charts) or too gamified (losing meaning after initial novelty). None of them offer a relationship — a companion who remembers your story, knows your triggers, and fights alongside you.

**Why Existing Solutions Fail:**
1. **Reactive, not proactive** — they log events but don't predict or prevent crises
2. **Motivational burnout** — clinical UX and generic "motivational fluff" cause abandonment
3. **Privacy concerns** — health and conversation data sent to cloud AI services erodes trust
4. **Cost per user** — cloud LLM APIs make generous free tiers unsustainable, pushing paywalls early
5. **Generic experience** — no personality, no emotional bond, no continuity between sessions

**Claiire's Thesis:** A locally-running AI companion that remembers your story, costs nothing per conversation, and gamifies real-life outcomes (not app usage) creates a sustainable emotional bond that breaks the 30-day retention ceiling.

---

## 3. Hypothesis

We believe that **providing an empathetic, on-device AI companion that gamifies real-life wellness outcomes with personalized encouragement and predictive intervention** for **adults struggling with addictions, mental health management, and consistent self-care routines** will result in **30-day retention reaching 35% and time-to-first-streak dropping to 7 days**, because **users need an emotional ally that transforms their data into meaning — not another tracking dashboard — and the on-device LLM removes the cost barrier to unlimited free conversations, creating a moat competitors can't match with cloud APIs**.

---

## 4. Success Criteria

**Success Thresholds:**
- ✅ 30-day retention ≥ 35%
- ✅ Onboarding completion ≥ 80% (first goal set within 2 minutes)
- ✅ Average streak length ≥ 14 days within first month
- ✅ Crisis logging → 48-hour companion check-in completion ≥ 70%
- ✅ Intervention success rate > 50% marked "this helped"
- ✅ Free → Premium conversion ≥ 5%

**Does NOT Count as Success:**
- High daily sessions but low retention (engagement without stickiness)
- High retention but no behavior change (measured by mood/habit consistency)
- Positive feedback without metric movement
- Users addicted to the app rather than to improving their lives (AD-9b)

**Leading Indicators:**
- Time spent in companion conversations (emotional bond forming)
- Streak milestone celebration engagement (XP/badge interaction)
- Crisis moment → intervention → recovery pathway completion rate
- Pattern confirmation rate (user validates AI predictions)
- Companion switching frequency (low = strong bond)

---

## 5. Non-Goals

**Explicit Scope Boundaries:**
- Will NOT provide clinical mental health treatment or replace therapy
- Will NOT include social features or community elements (v1)
- Will NOT integrate with external health devices initially (HealthKit/Google Fit = Phase 2)
- Will NOT use cloud AI for companion conversations (on-device only)
- Will NOT launch with 3D rendering as default (2D-first, 3D opt-in)
- Will NOT support web at MVP (mobile-only, web = Phase 3)

**Acknowledged Trade-offs:**
- On-device LLM (1-3B params) is less capable than cloud models — mitigated by strong system prompts, personality templates, and pre-written responses for critical interactions
- Prioritizing retention over feature breadth may limit initial acquisition channels
- Warrior/Zen dual mode adds UI complexity — justified by persona research showing divergent preferences
- Model download (300MB-2GB) creates first-launch friction — mitigated by two-stage download and instant template-based conversations

**Future Scope (Post-MVP):**
- Healthcare provider portal integration
- Family/caregiver sharing features
- Wearable integration (Apple Watch, Wear OS)
- AR companion, voice assistant integration
- Anonymous community (companion-moderated)

---

## 6. Solution Description

**Core Experience:**
Users select a personalized AI companion during onboarding who provides contextual encouragement based on tracked wellness data (habits, mood, crisis moments, interventions). The companion transforms routine logging into meaningful conversations and celebrates real-life progress through XP systems, streaks, and personalized insights. All AI runs locally on the device — zero cost, total privacy.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Users feel emotionally supported rather than judged by their wellness data
- Behavior change becomes sustainable through consistent positive reinforcement tied to real outcomes
- Crisis moments become opportunities for structured recovery rather than shame spirals
- Daily self-care feels achievable and rewarding rather than overwhelming
- The companion remembers the user's story across sessions, creating an emotional bond that drives retention

**Core Philosophy:** Claiire is not a tracking app. It is a combat system disguised as a game, where users fight their demons with real weapons (data, AI, interventions), earn victories (streaks, insights), and level up their lives — without realizing they're in therapy.

**Differentiator:** 100% on-device AI companion (zero API cost, total privacy). The local LLM is Claiire's cost moat — competitors pay per API call, Claiire doesn't. This enables an genuinely generous free tier: unlimited companion chat for everyone.

- **Hybrid response strategy:**
  - Pre-written templates for predictable interactions (XP celebrations, streak congrats, check-in prompts, intervention coaching) — instant, lightweight
  - Local LLM for free-form conversation, personalized responses, contextual coaching, crisis support
- **Two-stage model download (AD-10a):**
  - Stage 1 (auto): micro-model ~300-500MB (Gemma 2B Q4_0), downloads silently after install
  - Stage 2 (optional): full model ~1-2GB, offered as upgrade later
  - Templates work immediately before any model downloads
- **Runtime abstraction (AD-12a):** `generateResponse(prompt, config) → stream<tokens>` — swappable backend (llama.cpp today, Apple Intelligence / Gemini Nano tomorrow)

### 8.3 Memory System (Three-Level)

- **Immediate:** last 5-10 messages in LLM prompt context
- **Session:** daily conversation summary (LLM-generated)
- **Long-term:** key facts as KV pairs (enemy name, streak records, victory milestones) injected into system prompt, stored via Convex Vector Search

### 8.4 Emotional Expression

- 8 core emotions + victory celebration mode
- Rive state machines per emotion, triggered by conversation context
- Transitions between emotions are fluid and animated
- Config-driven personalities (AD-5): adding a companion = adding a config file, not code

### 8.5 Daily Rhythms

- **Morning:** "Bonjour ! XP d'hier: [amount]. Missions du jour: [list]. On y va ?"
- **Throughout day:** proactive messages at predicted risk times (configurable frequency)
- **Evening:** "Bilan: [X] missions, [Y] XP, [Z] batailles gagnées. Fier(e) ?"

### 8.6 Smart Questions (6 Types)

- Open-ended exploration, pattern investigation, trigger drilling, intervention evaluation, goal clarification, emotional validation
- Limit: 1-2 questions per interaction
- Never during crisis logging (wait until intervention phase)

### 8.7 Safety & Guardrails

---

### 9.2 Onboarding — Companion-Led Discovery (P0)

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to discover the app as a game where I'm the hero, not as "another self-help tool."

**Design Principles:**
- Zero onboarding screens. No tutorial. No feature tour. (AD-9e)
- Learn by doing — progressive disclosure through companion interaction
- Immediate immersion: app opens directly into companion world
- First concrete goal set within 2 minutes of first launch
- Templates written by copywriters, not AI-generated (AD-13d)

**Flow:**
1. App opens → companion appears (animated, in their world)
2. Choose companion by interacting (tap to visit their mini-world, selection = natural click)
3. Companion asks about the user's goal via conversation (free text or floating bubbles)
4. First crisis logging taught through companion-driven simulated experience
5. Features revealed progressively via behavior-driven discovery calendar (AD-12e, AD-13c)

**Discovery Calendar (config-driven, NOT time-based — AD-13c):**
- User states goal → immediate mission creation
- User logs crisis → immediate intervention suggestion
- Day 3: "J'ai quelque chose à te montrer" → War Room reveal
- Day 5: breathing exercise suggested during conversation
- Day 7: "J'ai détecté un pattern..." → Insights reveal
- Therapist mention → PDF export revealed (AD-13f)

**Dual Presentation Mode (AD-13b):**
- **Warrior mode:** Missions, battles, XP, arsenal, War Room, SOS button
- **Zen mode:** Habits, journal, progress, tools, dashboard, "Comment je me sens"
- User chooses during first interaction or companion suggests based on language
- Same underlying system, two UI skins — switchable anytime in settings

---

## 11. Technical Architecture

### 11.1 Stack (Decided — Do Not Change)

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Frontend | React Native (Expo ~55) + TypeScript strict | EAS Dev Build required (no Expo Go) |
| Navigation | Expo Router ~55 (file-based) | 4 tabs + modals |
| Companion Animations | Rive (`rive-react-native`) | State machines per emotion |
| UI Animations | Reanimated 4.x | |
| Backend | Convex | Reactive DB, mutations, queries, actions, vector search, scheduled jobs |
| Auth | Clerk (Expo SDK) | Social login, biometric |
| LLM | llama.rn (on-device) | Gemma 2B / Llama 3.2 3B, GGUF format |
| STT | Native iOS/Android | Free |
| TTS | Native iOS/Android | Free |
| State (UI) | Zustand | UI-only; Convex = data source of truth |
| Storage | expo-secure-store (auth) + MMKV (app state) | |
| Payments | RevenueCat (mobile MVP) + Polar (web Phase 3) | |
| Charts | Victory Native | |
| Notifications | Expo Notifications (FCM + APNS) | |
| CI/CD | EAS Build + GitHub Actions | |
| Crash/Error | Sentry | |

### 11.2 Key Architectural Decisions

| AD | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| AD-1 | 2D default, 3D opt-in only | Mid-range phones can't sustain 60fps 3D + chat. GPU benchmark at first launch. |
| AD-2 | 100% on-device LLM | Zero cost, total privacy, no external dependency. Trade-off: smaller models mitigated by templates + system prompts. |
| AD-3 | Cloud-first with offline degradation | Convex for persistence/sync. Emergency cache (~50KB) for offline: top 3 interventions, contacts, breathing exercise, missions. Companion still talks offline (local LLM). |
| AD-4 | Centralized XP Engine | Single Convex mutation `awardXP()`. XP touches 13+ features — distributed logic = bugs. Central config for rebalancing. |
| AD-5 | Config-driven companions | Personality = data files, not code. 5 companions × 13 features = 65 variations. Config-driven = one codebase, N personalities. |
| AD-6 | GDPR deletion by design | `deleteAllUserData(userId)` is a day-1 mutation, tested in CI. All tables indexed by userId. Vector embeddings tagged for cascade deletion. Completes in <30s. |
| AD-7 | Conservative prediction alerting | Only fire at >85% confidence. False positives → user disables alerts → useless. 14-day minimum data collection. |
| AD-8 | Security by design | Local AI (8a), crisis keyword interception before LLM (8b), output filtering (8c), biometric-gated sensitive actions (8d), discreet notifications (8e), cert pinning (8f), E2E encrypted conversations with password-derived key (8g). |
| AD-9 | First principles | Instant response <1s (9a), gamification = real outcomes not app usage (9b), 2D/1D default (9c), two-tier app <100MB + model download (9d), progressive disclosure not onboarding (9e), data separation device vs cloud (9f). |
| AD-10 | Cross-functional | Two-stage model download (10a), trust-based XP (10b), Convex with repository pattern exit strategy (10c), 3 companions at MVP (10d), RevenueCat only at MVP (10e). |
| AD-11 | Architecture records | Flat project structure (11a), conversation pipeline: Input → Safety → Router → Personality → Output Filter → Memory → Display (11b), Convex scheduled pattern detection (11c), Expo Router 4-tab nav (11d), schema separation readable vs encrypted (11e). |
| AD-12 | Market & positioning | LLM runtime abstraction (12a), wellness not medical positioning (12b), generous free tier (12c), anonymous collective stats (12d), companion discovery calendar (12e), safe/forbidden vocabulary (12g), art direction priority (12f). |
| AD-13 | User validation | No punishment on relapse (13a), dual Warrior/Zen mode (13b), adaptive discovery calendar (13c), copywriter-written templates (13d), model size optimization (13e), therapist sharing via discovery (13f). |

## 14. Market Positioning & Vocabulary (AD-12b)

**Phase 1 (Launch):** Claiire is a "wellness companion that helps you overcome toxic habits, manage crises, and build a healthier life, with gamification."

**Safe vocabulary:** surmonter tes habitudes toxiques, combattre ce qui te freine, reprendre le contrôle, ancrer des habitudes saines, gestion de crise, moments difficiles, comprendre tes patterns, accompagnement.

**Forbidden vocabulary:** traitement, thérapie, soigner, diagnostic, sevrage, trouble, maladie, patient.

**Rationale:** Empowerment framing, not medical framing. The user is the hero, not the patient. Legal review required before launch (French CNIL + EU health app regulations).

**Phase 2 (Post-traction):** Clinical validation pursued from a position of strength — existing users, real data, hired professionals. Certifications (CE, potentially FDA) only with professional guidance.

**Anonymous Social Proof (AD-12d):** "X guerriers se battent avec toi en ce moment" — live Convex query, anonymized. No profiles, no forums, just the feeling of not being alone.

## 15. Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (3-4 months)
- Auth (Clerk) + Convex schema
- 3 companions (Lumo, Papillon, Étoile) with Rive animations
- On-device LLM (llama.rn) + pre-written templates (copywriter quality — AD-13d)
- Companion conversation system (memory, emotions, daily rhythms)
- Companion-led onboarding (progressive disclosure, zero tutorial screens)
- Habit tracking (3 free, missions UI, dual Warrior/Zen labels)
- Crisis logging (Battle Report, <10 seconds)
- Basic interventions (20, companion-guided)
- Pattern detection (rule-based, Convex scheduled jobs)
- Dashboard (streaks, basic charts, companion commentary)
- XP system (centralized engine — AD-4)
- Dual mode: Warrior / Zen (AD-13b)
- Notifications (reminders, companion messages, discreet — AD-8e)
- RevenueCat subscription
- Offline emergency cache (AD-3)
- Security: E2E encryption, crisis interception, output filtering, GDPR deletion

### Phase 2: AI Enhancement (2-3 months)
- Add Sage + Aurore companions (config files + 2D assets only)
- Full emotional range (8 emotions)
- Advanced memory (conversation highlights, milestones)
- ML-based pattern prediction (TensorFlow Lite / Core ML)
- Predictive crisis alerts (>85% confidence)
- Intervention effectiveness tracking + arsenal stats
- Advanced analytics dashboard (War Room)
- Health data integration (HealthKit / Google Fit)
- PDF export for therapist (biometric-gated)
- Voice input/output (native STT/TTS)

### Phase 3: Companion Worlds & Scale (3-4 months)
- Companion world environments (Map View)
- Musical tracks per companion (XP-gated)
- Visual customization & cosmetic shop
- Companion switching system
- Routines (morning/night, companion-guided)
- Web dashboard
- Polar payments (web)
- Multilingual support (French-first, then English, Spanish)
- Anonymous collective stats

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Ongoing)
- Companion evolution (visual growth with user progress)
- Wearable integration (Apple Watch, Wear OS)
- Voice assistant integration (Siri, Google Assistant)
- AR companion
- Anonymous community (companion-moderated)

## 16. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Low user engagement / 30-day churn | High | Companion emotional bond, gamification tied to real outcomes, progressive discovery, smart notifications |
| AI predictions inaccurate | Medium | Start rule-based, >85% confidence threshold, user feedback loop, show confidence scores |
| Privacy concerns | High | 100% on-device AI, E2E encrypted conversations, GDPR deletion day-1, transparent policy |
| Medical liability | High | Safe vocabulary guide, clear disclaimers, crisis resources (hotlines), encourage professional help, legal review |
| LLM quality (small models) | Medium | Strong system prompts, config-driven personality, pre-written templates for critical interactions, two-stage model upgrade |
| Device performance (3D + LLM) | Medium | 2D default, GPU benchmark, 3D opt-in only, LLM and 3D never simultaneous |
| Model download friction | Medium | Two-stage download (300MB auto → 1-2GB opt), templates work instantly, Wi-Fi recommended UI |
| Competition | Low | On-device LLM cost moat, companion personality/memory, privacy-first positioning, generous free tier |
| Companion becomes unhelpful/repetitive | Medium | Copywriter-written templates (AD-13d), three-level memory system, user feedback on companion quality |

## 17. Compliance

- **GDPR:** Full compliance. `deleteAllUserData()` tested in CI. Data export mutation alongside deletion (AD-10c). Completes in <30 seconds.
- **HIPAA:** Considerations applied. On-device AI processing eliminates most data concerns. E2E encryption for cloud-stored conversations.
- **App Store / Play Store:** No medical claims. Wellness/personal development category. Crisis resources accessible.
- **French CNIL:** Legal review required before launch.
- **Content Safety:** Crisis resources (hotlines) always accessible. Disclaimers on all AI interactions. Crisis keyword interception before LLM.

## 18. Open Questions

| # | Question | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Voice quality per companion with native TTS? | Needs testing |
| 2 | RAG context: how many days of conversation history? | TBD — depends on Convex vector search performance |
| 3 | Music: commission original or royalty-free? | TBD |
| 4 | World interactivity depth? | TBD — start minimal, expand based on engagement |
| 5 | Is 3 habits enough for free tier? | TBD — monitor conversion rates post-launch |
| 6 | Smallest viable model size? | Test TinyLlama 1.1B, Gemma 2B Q2, Phi-3 mini Q3 |
| 7 | Art direction: who creates 2D companion assets? | TBD — priority investment (AD-12f) |
| 8 | Community: in-app or Discord? | Deferred to Phase 4 |
| 9 | Therapist portal: custom or integrate existing? | Deferred — PDF export first |
| 10 | Localization timing? | French-first confirmed, English in Phase 3 |
